<h1>LEARNINGS OF THE DAYS</h1>

<div id="content">
<p>21 April<br>Most of the people live scripted life. They do works that are said by the surrounding people. <br><br>Do this degree, because most people are doing this. Wear it, because it is fashionable, whether it is comfortable or not. <br><br>
23 April<br>• Some kind of good friends make your life so awesome. 🥰🥰<br><br>• NEVER break small deciplines, it may lead you to a big mistake.<br><br><br><br>

24 April <br>• Sometimes you have to accept some things in order to move forward. and it ain't no harm.<br><br><br>• Gaining knowledge is good, implementing that knowledge is too good. - Papa<br><br><br><br>

25 April<br>• 'No respond mode' makes distraction free environment. 🤣<br><br>• People give advice, but they don't follow. It is common thing in our society.<br><br>• If you have a diamond, people would say, ohh man! you have only one. (Even he hasn't a diamond)<br><br>That's why, we should not focus on people's words.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

26 April<br>• Today I was not getting anything, what should I write on LOD? - In such a situation, usually we procrastinate or leave it. So today's learning is, whatever happens, do not break your habit.<br><br><br><br>• "I still don't know anything"- makes me energetic. And what does make you energetic?<br><br><br><br>

27 April<br>• Take steps, no matter how small.<br><br><br><br>

28 April<br>Places doesn't matter, your dedication and commitment depend.<br><br><br><br>

29 April<br>• So many things are good just as long as you don’t know they’re bad. <br><br>• Isn’t it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it yet?<br><br><br><br>

30 April<br>• Having two faces of yourself in front of people will be bad. <br><br>Let a person puts entertaining status everyday, suddenly one day, he puts a valuable status in between two statuses. <br><br>It will be ignored. Right??<br><br>We do same mistake in everyday life. Make one image only.<br><br><br><br>

01 May<br>The biggest reason for wasting time is not planning or not having a goal.<br><br><br><br>02 May<br><br>• Experience can never be shared in words. <br><br>• Changing beliefs is necessary.<br><br><br><br>03 May<br><br>Consume or learn that will help you in your goal.<br><br><br><br>04 May<br><br>• Sometime you don't see many persons who accepted you for what you are,<br><br>But all you notice the person who doesn't. <br><br><br><br>• Reward makes us motivated for doing next steps, but it doesn't mean if you do not get the reward, then leave it.<br><br><br><br>05 May<br><br>Arousing interest in anything depends on how you think about it and how you achieve it. It doesn't depend on environment as we say, I'm interested in this subject and that subject.<br><br><br><br>06 May<br><br>• Mind is flexible and variable, adjust it, to see a better result and better world. <br><br>• Mindset is very powerful. ( Perhaps I can't say it in words, how strong, because it is a thing to experience )<br><br>• I don't think, fear is so bad, because of this, I do many things. And later it turns out, oh thanks God, I did it, it was really important.<br><br><br><br>07 May<br><br>• Sometimes what we love most, it becomes our biggest weakness.<br><br>• Anything is decided according to time, position and situation. E.g. killing man is bad,<br><br> but Lord Rama killed Ravana, and it was good.<br><br><br><br>08 May<br><br>• Don't judge the hardness or softness of a problem without attempting it once.<br><br>• Gaining experiences with observation is better than only gaining experiences.<br><br><br><br>09 May<br><br>Take steps at right time, neither before nor after.<br><br><br><br>10 May<br><br>• If you like something, it doesn't mean everyone would like it.<br><br>• There is many ways to think about anything.<br><br><br><br>11 May<br><br>• Just have courage, life can be started from anywhere.<br><br>• Do not love sleep so much that even the destination becomes a dream.<br><br><br><br>12 May<br><br>• Get out of bed in the morning with determination and come back at night with satisfaction of mind.<br><br>• People are strange, they can do anything. They can ignore, they can reject.<br><br><br><br>13 May<br><br>• Problems seem difficult when viewed from a distance, but in reality they are not.<br><br>• Procrastination can provide short-term relief, but it can affect your long-term effectiveness.<br><br><br><br><br><br>14 May<br><br>• There are some people in life who help us without any sincerity. They do not need anything in return. We must respect them.<br><br><br><br>• Sometimes, we procrastinate, not because of laziness, because of fear.<br><br><br><br>• Let t = 0 (where, t=time)<br><br>Energy = E (where, E != 0)<br><br>t=0, that means nothing is wrong. <br><br>And E != 0, ( you can do anything )<br><br>Hence, we have power to do something spacial and big.<br><br><br><br><br><br>15 May<br><br>• People give their views according to themselves. They speak like this, it seems that they are speaking right. But it does not mean that they are telling the right.<br><br><br><br>• We have one life. <br><br>But we don't need to be one person.<br><br><br><br>16 May<br><br>• Many people talk too much without any reason.

Regret is a form of punishment itself. <br><br>• People are good, when you do good with them.<br><br><br><br><br><br>19 May<br><br>• Do not expect from people, that people will do what you like?<br><br>• Everyone is imperfect at some point. Don't make him/her joke at that point.<br><br><br><br>20 May<br><br>• Learn to accept reality. No matter how negative the experience is.<br><br> When you accept a negative experience, you can accept it as it is, and turn it into a positive one.<br><br>• Keep practicing is the only way to achieve dreams.<br><br><br><br>21 May<br><br>• Controlling your emotions makes you stronger.<br><br>• It can ruin your life only if it ruins your character.<br><br>—MARCUS AURELIUS<br><br>• Those who know do not speak.<br><br>Those who speak do not know.<br><br> —LAO TZU<br><br><br><br>22 May<br><br>• We get failures in many things, because we have more than one options.<br><br>• When the person in front is not ready to accept you are right, then there is no benefit by trying to become right in front of him. ( When you are sure, you are right, he is wrong )<br><br><br><br>23 May<br><br>• We know others through their actions. We know ourselves through our thoughts.<br><br>• Work on yourself<br><br>• Helping people gives internal satisfaction.<br><br><br><br>24 May<br><br>• “You’re not defined by your past; you’re prepared by it.
